# Identifying pattern in buses breakdown and delays using MSExcel

## Table of Content

## Data Source
- The `Bus_Breakdown_and_Delays_NYC Project (1)` file from **Alextheanalyst**, attached to the files in this project.

## Tools
- MSExcel

## Objective(s)
- The new york division of transportation as asked our help to
improve the efficiency and reliablity of the city's bus transport system.
The city is experiencing a lot of breakdown and delays, and these has been causing inconviniencies to commuters.
My objective is to analyse the data and identify patterns that contributes to these breakdowns and delays.

## Qustions
- What are the common reasons for delay?
- How do delay times vary by bus company and boroughs?
- Is there a corrolation between specific days of the week and frequency of breakdown or delay?

## Data preparation and cleaning
- the column Occured_on has the data accidents or delays occured in a
mm/dd/yyyy HH:MM format, for easier analysis, I created another
column by the right and made the theme color yellow, I named this
column Day_occured, where (1 is sunday and 7 is saturday), therefore,
9/1/2022 is 5 and 9/2/2022 is 6 and so on.
